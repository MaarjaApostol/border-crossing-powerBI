### Overview

Initially this dataset was chosen to be used fully in Excel, from cleansing to visualisations. But as Excel kept crashing I decided to use Power BI instead alongside completing the Power BI Data Analyst Associate path and some additional modules on the Microsoft Learn platform.

**Data source:** https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/border-crossing-entry-data-683ae

**Access:** This dataset is intended for public access and use.

**License:** No license information was provided. If this work was prepared by an officer or employee of the United States government as part of that person's official duties it is considered aÂ [U.S. Government Work](http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/). 

### Background

The dataset covers two borders - US-Mexico and US-Canada and is for inbound movement only. It includes trucks, trains, buses, personal vehicles, and their passengers, and also pedestrians. 

**File type**: CSV file

**Number of records:** 396401

**Data date range:** January 1996 until October 

I decided to compare two decades - 2000 - 2009 and 2010 - 2019, whilst only looking at the movement of people (train passengers, pedestrians, personal vehicle passengers, bus passengers).

### Data transformation in Excel

| Column    | Converted to type:                     | Errors | NULL values |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Port Name | text                                   | None   | None        |
| State     | text                                   | None   | None        |
| Port Code | text                                   | None   | None        |
| Border    | text                                   | None   | None        |
| Date      | date (mm-yy)                           | None   | None        |
| Measure   | text                                   | None   | None        |
| Value     | number                                 | None   | 122402      |
| Latitude  | number with 4 decimal places           | None   | None        |
| Longitude | number with 4 decimal places           | None   | None        |
| Point     | not converted (Latitude and Longitude) | None   | None        |

[x] Split *Date* column into two - *Month*, *Year*

[x] Created new column *ID* as a combo of *Port Code*, *Measure*, *Month*, *Year*

[x] Applied Conditional Formatting to spot duplicates in the *ID* column, none found but when I applied Remove Duplicates it then removed 11 values. Third check completed with COUNTIF(A:A,A1)>1 where the result was FALSE.

[x] Removed the column *ID* following duplicates check.

[x] Removed the column *Point* as latitude and longitude already present in separate columns.

### Data transformation in Power BI

[x] Filtered out rows of *Value* = *0* prior to applying transformations to the dataset.

[x] Checked Column distribution, Column profile, and Column quality based on the entire data set.
[x] Filtered for years 2000-2019.
